"""What is actually running: interpreter, inference library, active backends.

WHY THIS EXISTS, SEPARATE FROM detect_hw()
    `core.model_manager.detect_hw()` answers what the machine HAS: processor,
    memory, graphics card. This module answers what the application IS USING,
    which is a different question and the one that goes unanswered when a user
    reports that inference is slow or broken.

    The distinction is not academic. A machine with a 16 GB Radeon reports that
    card in detect_hw() while the model runs entirely on the processor,
    because acceleration is a compile-time choice in the inference library and
    not a property of the hardware. Reading only the hardware there suggests a
    GPU is in use when none is.

WHY THE BACKEND LIST IS READ FROM THE LIBRARY AND NOT ASSUMED
    ggml registers one backend per accelerator it could load, and the list is
    the ground truth: it says whether the build that shipped can talk to the
    graphics card at all. Nothing else does. It is also cheap - no model is
    loaded to ask.

NO PERSONAL DATA
    Everything here is a version, a name or a flag. Paths are deliberately
    absent: an interpreter path or a model path carries the account name of
    whoever is running the application. Model files are reported by file name
    only, which names the model and nobody else.

    Importing llama_cpp is enough to register the backends that were linked at
    build time. Builds made with dynamic backends register nothing until
    somebody loads them, and the loader is called by the code that creates the
    model; asking here before that has happened would under-report, so the
    caller is expected to ask after a model has been built at least once, or to
